# Win10-LPE
The Windows 10 LPE exploit written by SandboxEscaper

This includes the source code for the original exploit, a precompiled DLL injector binary included with the original source, and a powershell script to find potentially vulnerable libraries to overwrite for the exploit.

Repo is a WIP and will include further code, explanations, and documentation in the near future. Use at your own risk.
